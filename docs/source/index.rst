Welcome to CROCO-ABL1d tutorial
===================================

The purpose of this tutorial is to present the different steps to set up :

* an idealized simulation with the ABL1d based on :cite:p:`spall_midlatitude_2007,kilpatrick_boundary_2014,ayet_analytical_2019,lemarie_simplified_2021` case study (Section :ref:`section_kilpatrick`) ;

* a real case ABL1d - CROCO based on BENGUELA_LR ktest.
  
Description of the ABL1d model can be found in :cite:p:`lemarie_simplified_2021`. Same version of the ABL1d model has been implemented in CROCO.

.. note::

   This tutorial is under development.
