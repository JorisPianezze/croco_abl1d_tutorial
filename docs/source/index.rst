Welcome to CROCO-ABL1d tutorial
===================================

The purpose of this tutorial is to present the different steps to set up an idealized simulation with the ABL1d based on Kilpatrick et al. 2014 case study
and a real case ABL1d - CROCO based on BENGUELA_LR ktest. Description of the ABL1d model can be found in :cite:p:`lemarie_2021` paper.
Same version of the ABL1d model has been implemented in CROCO.
