            Recent studies indicate that the influence of midlatitude SST fronts extends through the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) into the free atmosphere, with implications for climate variability. To better understand the mechanisms of this ocean-to-atmosphere influence, SST-induced MABL convergence is explored here with the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model in an idealized, dry, two-dimensional configuration, for winds crossing from cold to warm SST and from warm to cold SST. 
            For strong cross-front winds, O(10 m s−1), changes in the turbulent mixing and MABL depth across the SST front lead to MABL depth-integrated convergence in the cold-to-warm case and depth-integrated divergence in the warm-to-cold case. The turbulent stress divergence term changes over a shorter length scale than the pressure gradient and Coriolis terms, such that the MABL response directly above the SST front is governed by nonrotating, internal boundary layer–like physics, which are consistent with the vertical mixing mechanism. An important consequence is that the increment in the cross-front surface stress diagnoses the vertical motion at the top of the MABL. These physics are at variance with some previously proposed SST frontal MABL models in which pressure adjustments determine the MABL convergence. 
            The SST-induced MABL convergence results in vertical motion that excites a stationary internal gravity wave in the free atmosphere, analogous to a mountain wave. For a 15 m s−1 cross-front wind, the gravity wave forced by an SST increase of 3°C over 200 km is comparable to that forced by an 80-m change in topography.},

            The influences of strong gradients in sea surface temperature on near-surface cross-front winds are explored in a series of idealized numerical modeling experiments. The atmospheric model is the Naval Research Laboratory Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) model, which is fully coupled to the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) ocean model. A series of idealized, two-dimensional model calculations is carried out in which the wind blows from the warm-to-cold side or the cold-to-warm side of an initially prescribed ocean front. The evolution of the near-surface winds, boundary layer, and thermal structure is described, and the balances in the momentum equation are diagnosed. The changes in surface winds across the front are consistent with previous models and observations, showing a strong positive correlation with the sea surface temperature and boundary layer thickness. The coupling arises mainly as a result of changes in the flux Richardson number across the front, and the strength of the coupling coefficient grows quadratically with the strength of the cross-front geostrophic wind. The acceleration of the winds over warm water results primarily from the rapid change in turbulent mixing and the resulting unbalanced Coriolis force in the vicinity of the front. Much of the loss/gain of momentum perpendicular to the front in the upper and lower boundary layer results from acceleration/deceleration of the flow parallel to the front via the Coriolis term. This mechanism is different from the previously suggested processes of downward mixing of momentum and adjustment to the horizontal pressure gradient, and is active for flows off the equator with sufficiently strong winds. Although the main focus of this work is on the midlatitude, strong wind regime, calculations at low latitudes and with weak winds show that the pressure gradient and turbulent mixing terms dominate the cross-front momentum budget, consistent with previous work.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A simplified model of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
of intermediate complexity between a bulk parameterization and a three-dimensional
atmospheric model is developed and integrated to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) general circulation model.
An objective in the derivation of such a simplified model, called ABL1d, is
to reach an apt representation in ocean-only numerical simulations of some of the
key processes associated with air–sea interactions at the characteristic scales of
the oceanic mesoscale. In this paper we describe the formulation of the
ABL1d model and the strategy to constrain this model with large-scale
atmospheric data available from reanalysis or real-time forecasts. A particular
emphasis is on the appropriate choice and calibration of a turbulent closure scheme
for the atmospheric boundary layer. This is a key ingredient to properly represent
the air–sea interaction processes of interest. We also provide a detailed description
of the NEMO-ABL1d coupling infrastructure and its computational efficiency.
The resulting simplified model is then tested for several boundary-layer regimes
relevant to either ocean–atmosphere or sea-ice–atmosphere coupling. The coupled
system is also tested with a realistic 0.25∘ resolution global configuration.
The numerical results are evaluated using standard metrics
from the literature to quantify the wind–sea-surface-temperature
(a.k.a. thermal feedback effect),
wind–current (a.k.a. current feedback effect), and ABL–sea-ice couplings.
With respect to these metrics, our results show very good agreement with observations
and fully coupled ocean–atmosphere models for a computational overhead of about
9 \% in terms of elapsed time compared to standard uncoupled simulations.
This moderate overhead, largely due to I/O operations, leaves room for further
improvement to relax the assumption of horizontal homogeneity behind ABL1d
and thus to further improve the realism of the coupling while keeping the flexibility
of ocean-only modeling.},
